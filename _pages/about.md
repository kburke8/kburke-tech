Hey! I'm Kyle Burke - I'm a Software Developer by day, Dad by evening, and a Gamer by night.

I've been developing software for over 8 years using the Microsoft techstack, focused mainly on back-end development of REST services in the Cloud using Azure.

I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2013 and worked at General Motors in Chandler, AZ for almost 6 years before transitioning to my current place of employment at PrizeLogic where we create digital engagements ranging from promotions to loyalty sites. As part of the Enterprise Engineering team I am focused on creating the next-gen platform that all of our engagements will utilize.
